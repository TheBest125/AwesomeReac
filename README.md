## About

- This page provides a list with examples of libraries and components that you can use to develop web pages and apps with React without any build tools.
- Development build tools and projects such as `webpack`, `babel`, and `create-react-app` are great but they do not make sense for all sites, web pages, and development workflows.
- With browser based options for JSX you can **easily include React Components on any page** without having to build the entire site using React or JSX.
- Reasons why you might want to do this can include:
  - üöÄ **Fast Development** üöÄ Because there is no build process you can create and modify sites using any editor on any system.
  - ü§ù **Easily Share** ü§ù Provide React code snippets to designers or web developers who do not know or use JavaScript.
  - üì¶ **Project Size** üì¶ This site includes many example mini apps and each one is typically less than 10 kB in size while a standard React app using `create-react-app`  is between 150 and 250 MB and includes over 30,000 files.
  - üìÑ **Add to any Page** üìÑ Add React to legacy and existing sites or web pages. Often React is used on new projects only but with online development options you can include React and Libraries directly from a CDN or JavaScript files.
  - üè´ **Learn React** üè´ Web Development with only a Browser and a Text Editor is any easy way to get started with React or try new ideas and features.
  - üöÜ **Rapid Prototyping** üöÜ Instantly develop ideas and into quick apps and then migrate to a build process later if you want to.
- You can try all examples in your browser at https://awesome-web-react.js.org/.
- All examples can be ran locally by downloading this repository and running `npm start`. Only node is required and no dependencies are needed.

## Web Based Development Options

- [Babel Standalone](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-standalone)
  - Standalone build of Babel for use in non-Node.js environments.
  - Babel Standalone is very large so using it for productions apps is generally not recommended in most situations.
  - However it is very useful for development because you can debug and step through code directly in browser with React Development Tools.
  - JSX Code used in a Browser with Babel Standalone can also be used for local development using `create-react-app` and other tools.
- [DataFormsJS JSX Loader](https://github.com/dataformsjs/dataformsjs/blob/master/docs/jsx-loader.md)
  - An ultra-fast and tiny (5.7 kB) browser based compiler for JSX / React.
  - Created for production use with all browsers. This list was created because of the JSX Loader and most examples use it.
  - The JSX Loader is designed for compatibility with Babel Standalone.
  - It compiles JSX to JS for modern browsers and for legacy browsers it will download and use Polyfills and Babel Standalone.
- [HTM (Hyperscript Tagged Markup)](https://github.com/developit/htm)
  - JSX alternative using standard tagged templates, with compiler support.
  - HTM is extremely small (~0.5 kB).
  - It provides many options and works with all modern browsers; however this means it will not work with legacy browsers.
- [React without JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html)
  - Most React apps are created using JSX, however it is not required and plain JavaScript can be used.
  - JSX is generally used because it allows for much more readable code and easier development with React.
